What drives the Used car prices up - a practical application assignment
- Tasks
Our challenge is to understand the factors that drive car pricing. In particular, understand the factors that affect the pricing of used cars in the American market. To do this, we need to find out:

1. Which and What variables are important when predicting the price of a car in the project.
2. How well these variables describe the price of the car.

Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of used cars across the American market.

- Our Goal
Our aim is to model the price of vehicles with available explanatory variables. It will be used by various Used Car dealers to understand exactly how prices change with the explanatory variables. Accordingly, they can change business strategy and will help them understand the dynamics of prices in the Used car market.
